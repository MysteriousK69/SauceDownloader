# SauceDownloader
In a degenerate server someone pinged everyone and said that nhentai removed cloudflare, so I thought that I might as well make this program to download sauces locally.
# Installation
1. Just get Python 3.9 and install requests, bs4.
2. Git clone the project.
# Usage
Just run main.py
# Support
Feel free to make issues, PRs, or donations at paypal.me/misuteriasuke
